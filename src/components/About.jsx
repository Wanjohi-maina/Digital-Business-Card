        I’m a front-end developer who enjoys bringing ideas to life in the
        browser. I love working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’ve been
        exploring React to build fun, responsive, and interactive projects.
      </p>
      <p className="about-para">
        I’m all about clean design, smooth user experiences, and writing code
        that just feels right. When I’m not tweaking layouts or fixing bugs, I’m
        probably learning something new to level up my web dev skills.
